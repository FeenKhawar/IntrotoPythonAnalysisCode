This repository are the code and examples done in Wes McKinney's Python for Data Analysis (3rd Edition) book, 
along with any notes I have on these code and examples. As I read through the book I followed along with its examples 
and played with the code to better understand the material.
Nearly all the code is commented so I could focus on each section individually and not have every section load at once when I only wanted to look at one part. If one wants to look through this code, uncommenting whole sections will allow you to run its code.
